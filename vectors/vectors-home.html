                <p>A vector is a quantity or phenomenon that has two independent properties: magnitude and direction. The term also denotes the mathematical or geometrical representation of such a quantity.
                    <br><br>
                    Examples of vectors in nature are velocity, momentum, force, electromagnetic fields and weight. A quantity or phenomenon that exhibits magnitude only, with no specific direction, is called a scalar. Examples of scalars include speed, mass, electrical resistance and hard drive storage capacity.</p>

                <p>Vectors are typically represented by an arrow with a beginning, or tail, and an end, or head, that is usually represented by an arrowhead. Vectors delineate the movement from point A to point B
                     and can be defined as an entity with a designation, such as vector a.</p>

                <p>In mathematics, the Cartesian coordinate system depicts vectors using a 
                    number pair as shown in Figure 1. In this example, the vector is a
                     directed line segment defined as (0,0), (7,7) using its numbered pairs. 
                     Vectors and scalars can be used in mathematical processes and vector 
                     operations, such as vector addition, vector subtraction and vector 
                     multiplication.</p>
